title: Groupon Visualization in HBR

[A version of my Groupon visualization](http://hbr.org/2011/07/vision-statement-deconstructing-the-groupon-phenomenon/ar/1) appears in the latest Harvard Business Review. At the suggestion of their editorial and design staff, I re-did the visualization to focus on a smaller subset of the data: deals in San Francisco.

I must give the HBR staff a lot of credit for the final product â€” they made a visualization designed to be interactive work in print.
